# Bakalan - experiments with the Smithy IDL

This repository is a place for experiments with the Smithy IDL and supporting
tools, libraries, etc. Things that emerge from here in useful form will get
their own repos, but for now it's just a place to hammer on hot metal and try
not to hurt myself.

**Etymology:** *Bakalan* is the Filipino (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­) word for "smithy".
