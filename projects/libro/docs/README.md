# Bakalan - experiments with the Smithy IDL

This repository is a place for experiments with the Smithy IDL and supporting
tools, libraries, etc. Things that emerge from here in useful form will get
their own repos, but for now it's just a place to hammer on hot metal and try
not to hurt myself.

**Etymology:** *Bakalan* is the Filipino (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­) word for "smithy".

# Projects <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

* [kamusta](kamusta/): A simple "hello, world" Smithy example.
* [pagbati](pagbati/): A basic greeting service (a more fully-worked evolution of _kamusta_).
